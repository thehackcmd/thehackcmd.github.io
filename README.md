# Web Tools

A collection of simple, client-side web tools designed to run entirely in the browser and be hosted easily using GitHub Pages.

## Included Tools

### Internet Archive Browser
Open any website directly from the Wayback Machine by specifying a URL and year.

### Reader Mode
Extracts and displays readable text content from public web pages in a clean, distraction-free layout.
(Note: Some websites block this due to CORS restrictions.)

### Universal Media Player
Plays media from supported platforms (YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud) using official embed players.
